# Digtial Painting Practice
This is a place where I post my random artwork projects. It involves full color paintings.

### Why do I post here?
Cause I am a COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT, there is no better place for me to post my recent projects.

### Why do I do this?
I am currently a game development stream student. Would it be too odd I can't design some in-game objects?

### My working platform
